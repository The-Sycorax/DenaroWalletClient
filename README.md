## Introduction
**This repo contains the source code for the Denaro Wallet Client, developed for the Denaro cryptocurrency. It has been designed with a strong emphasis on security, providing users with a secure and efficient way to manage their digital assets.** 

**The wallet client provides essential functionalities such as wallet creation, address generation, transaction processing, balance checking, and wallet imports. Advanced functionalities are also provided, including encryption and decryption capabilities, two-factor authentication (2FA), wallet entry filtering, support for deterministic wallets, and several security mechanisms to protect wallet data.**

## Wallet Security Framework
Paramount to it's design, the wallet client has been developed with a high-level of security in mind, perticularly for encrypted wallets. It features several protective security measures to safeguard and fortify wallet data. These measures include proof-of-work based brute-force protection, two-factor authentication, double-hashed password verification, and rigorous integrity checks of wallet data. Additionally, there are measures to identify and record unauthorized access attempts, along with an automatic wallet deletion feature which activates after 10 failed access attempts, providing an added layer of defense *([feat: Wallet Annihilation](https://github.com/The-Sycorax/DenaroWalletClient/commit/e347b6622d47415ddc531e8b3292c96b42128c9a))*.

Inherent to its architecture, the wallet client deeply inegrates and bakes these security measures directly into the cryptographic processes that are responsible for encrypting and decrypting wallet data. Central to this approach is a unique dual-layer technique that combines both the ChaCha20-Poly1305 and AES-GCM encryption algorithms. 

This encryption method is implemented in stages, beginning with the encryption of individual JSON key-value pairs of wallet data using the dual-layer technique. Afterwhich, the entire JSON entry that contains these encrypted key-value pairs is also encrypted, resulting in multiple layers of encryption. By implementing this multi-layered encryption approach along with the various security mechanisms, the wallet client not only secures wallet data but also substantially fortifies its underlying cryptographic keys against a variety of threats.

## Installation Guide
*Note: The Denaro Wallet Client has not been tested on Windows or MacOS and support is unknown at this time. It is reccomended to use the wallet client on Ubuntu/Debian Linux to avoid any compatibility or stability issues.*

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/The-Sycorax/DenaroWalletClient.git
cd DenaroWalletClient

# Update package list and install required library
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libgmp-dev

# Setting Up a Python Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)
# Install virtualenv with pip
pip install virtualenv
# Sometimes virtualenv requires the apt package to be installed
sudo apt install python3-venv
# Create the virtual environment
python3 -m venv env
# Activate the virtual environment. Should be executed every time that there is new terminal session.
source env/bin/activate

# Install the required packages

## Usage Documentation
- ### Command-Line Interface:

    **Overview**: The Denaro Wallet Client provides a rebust CLI for various operations. This section provides detailed usage documentation for the various sub-commands along with their corresponding options. 
    
    *Note: To ensure a high level of security, this wallet client is designed with an auto-delete feature for encrypted wallets. After 10 unsuccessful password attempts, the wallet will be automatically deleted in order to protect its contents and safeguard against unauthorized access. (For more details, please refer to: [feat: Wallet Annihilation](https://github.com/The-Sycorax/DenaroWalletClient/commit/e347b6622d47415ddc531e8b3292c96b42128c9a))*

        *If the specified wallet file already exists then the user will be prompted with a warning and asked if they want to backup the existing wallet. If the user chooses not to back up an existing wallet, then they will be prompted with an additional warning and asked to confirm the overwrite of the existing wallet. When overwriting an encrypted wallet, the password associated with the it is required, and the user will be prompted to type it in. The user can choose to bypass one or more of these prompts with the use of `-backup`, `-disable-overwrite-warning`, or `-overwrite-password` (Refer to [generate wallet](#generatewallet) options for details).*

        * *One or more fields can be specified and must be seperated by a comma `,`.*
        * *If one or more fields are not specified, then all fields are included in the filtered data (id, 
        mnemonic, private_key, public_key, and address).*
        * *Various filtering combinations can be used.*

        <summary>Filtering Examples:</summary>
            
        As mentioned in the usage documentation, the `balance` sub-command has a way to filter wallet entries similar to `decryptwallet filter`. The `-address` option can be used to filter one or more addresses that are associated with a wallet. Addresses can be excluded by adding a hyphen (`-`) to the beginning of it. Addresses can also be filtered based on origin (See `-show` option for more details).
        
        Many filter combinations can be used. Below are just a few examples but for more information please refer to the "Wallet Decryption with Filtering" section.
        
        *Note: If a wallet is encrypted, be sure to specify the password for it.*
        
        * Will only retrieve the balance information of imported wallet entries:
            
            ```bash
            python3 wallet_client.py balance -wallet=wallet.json -show=imported
            ```
        * Will only retrieve the balance information of generated wallet entries:
            
            ```bash
            python3 wallet_client.py balance -wallet=wallet.json -show=generated
            ```
        * Retrieves the balance information of a specific address associated with a wallet:
            
            ```bash
            python3 wallet_client.py balance -wallet=wallet.json -address=DuxRWZXZSeuWGmjTJ99GH5Yj5ri4kVy55MGFAL74wZcW4
            ```
        
        * Retrieves the balance information of multiple addresses associated with a wallet:
            
            ```bash
            python3 wallet_client.py balance -wallet=wallet.json -address=DuxRWZXZSeuWGmjTJ99GH5Yj5ri4kVy55MGFAL74wZcW4,DwpnwDyCTEXP4q7fLRzo4vwQvGoGuDKxikpCHB9BwSiMA
            ```
            
        * Retrieves the balance information of all wallet entries but excludes specific addresses:
        
            ```bash
            python3 wallet_client.py balance -wallet=wallet.json -address=-DuxRWZXZSeuWGmjTJ99GH5Yj5ri4kVy55MGFAL74wZcW4,-DwpnwDyCTEXP4q7fLRzo4vwQvGoGuDKxikpCHB9BwSiMA

        *Note: If a wallet is encrypted, be sure to specify the password for it.*

It is not reccomended to directly specify a private key, as this could lead to the irreversable loss of funds if anyone has access to it. The private key in this example was randomly generated and dose not have funds.*
        
        * Imports a wallet entry based on the private key of a Denaro address:
